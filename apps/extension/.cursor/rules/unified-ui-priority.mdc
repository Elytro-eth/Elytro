# Unified UI Priority

When working on UI in this extension, **always prioritize the shared UI package** (`@elytro/ui`) over app-specific implementations.

## Guidelines

1. **Check `@elytro/ui` first** - Before creating or modifying a component, check if it exists in `packages/ui/src/`
2. **Extend, don't duplicate** - If a similar component exists in the UI package, extend or compose it rather than creating a new one
3. **Propose additions** - If a component should be shared, suggest adding it to `@elytro/ui` instead of keeping it app-specific
4. **Consistent theming** - Use theme tokens and CSS variables from the UI package, not hardcoded values

## Package Structure

- **Shared UI**: `../../packages/ui/src/` (imported as `@elytro/ui`)
- **App-specific**: `./src/components/` (only for extension-specific components)

## When to Use App-Specific Components

Only create components in `./src/components/` when:
- The component is truly extension-specific (e.g., Chrome extension APIs)
- It composes multiple `@elytro/ui` components for a specific use case
- It requires extension-specific context or state
